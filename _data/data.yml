    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am currently a Ph.D. student in Robotics at the Colorado School of Mines. My research advisor is Dr. Qi Han, 
      the director of the Pervasive Computing Systems (PeCS) research group. My current research interests involves 
      exploring various machine learning techniques and the possibility of using Augmented Reality (AR) in the context 
      of networked robot systems. 

      I enjoy the process of problem solving and building my own systems. I am also a proficient piano player. 
      Currently, I am learning the bass guitar.
