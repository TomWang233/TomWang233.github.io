    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am currently a Ph.D. student in Robotics at the Colorado School of Mines. My research advisor is Dr. Qi Han, 
      the director of the Pervasive Computing Systems (PeCS) research group. My current research interests involves 
      edge computing and computation collaborations in the context of networked robot systems. 

      I enjoy the process of problem solving and building my own systems. I am also a proficient piano player. 
      Currently, I am learning the bass guitar.
